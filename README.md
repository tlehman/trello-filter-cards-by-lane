# Trello Filter Cards by Lane

A user script for hiding certain trello cards.

## Why does this exist?
It is an alternative to archiving, it keeps the cards visible to everyone else, but it allows you to ignore cards that are in 'Done' boards, such as 'Deployed', 'Finished', 'Delivered', etc.

## How to install

Install this `.user.js` file using Tampermonkey (for Chrome), Greasemonkey (for Firefox) or Greasekit (for Safari)

Then, visit the url `https://trello.com/<TRELLO_USERNAME>/cards?Lane2&Lane3, and the cards that are in those lanes will be css-display-none-d out of existence
